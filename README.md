# DataProducts
Repository for the Data Products course on Coursera (March - April 2016)

In the main directory the files for the Shiny App can be found. It is a simple app that calculates the BMI using the input values "weight" and "lenght". It then creates a little plot and tells you in what weight category you belong (underweight, obese, etc.). More information can be found in the documentation in this app.

Link to app: https://gd4pl4e.shinyapps.io/DataProducts/

In the ShinyApp folder you can find the slidify presentation abou the app.
